# A1 - Write code that prints ‘Hello world’

print("Hello world")

# A2 - Print the numbers 1 to 5 on a single line

print("1 2 3 4 5")

   
# A3 - Write a script where ‘Hello’ and ‘World’ are printed on two separate lines

print("Hello\nWorld")

# A4 - Write a script that prints a list of names, tabbed on separate lines, e.g.
#    ```My List of Names:
#            Alice
#            Bob
#            Charlie
#    ```

print("My List of Names:\n\tAlice\n\tBob\n\tCharlie")


# B1 - Write code that prints the value of 2 + 2

# Do the sum directly within the print statement
print(2 + 2)


# B2 - Write code that prints the value of 5.7 subtracted from 3.4

# Work out the sum and store in a variable before printing out
sum = 5.7 - 3.4
print(sum)

   
# B3 - Write code that prints the value of 8 multiplied by 7

print(8 * 7)

#B4 - Write code that prints the value of 144 divided by 12

# Using brackets to make the sum clear
result = (144 / 12)
print(result)

# B5 - Write code that prints the value of the remainder of 67 divided by 12

remainder = 67 % 12
print(remainder)

# B6 - Write code that finds the value of 20 from `4 - 2 * 6 / 3 * 5`. Hint: you might need brackets

# Without brackets
print(4 - 2 * 6 / 3 * 5) # 16

# With brackets to ensure the subtraction happens first
complex_sum = (4 - 2) * 6 / 3 * 5
print(complex_sum) # 20
